# Unit 1: My Family and Me

## Chapter 1: Two little hands

### Let us sing

Two little hands
go clap, clap, clap.
Two little legs
go tap, tap, tap.
Two little eyes
are open wide.
One little head
goes side to side.

Two little eyes to look around.
Two little ears to hear any sound.
One little nose to smell and breathe.
One little mouth that likes to eat.
Hands to clap, legs to walk
Nose to smell, mouth to talk
Head to move, eyes to see
I have a little body that belongs to me.

* Now circle ‘One, two, to’ in the song.

**Sight words**
| one | to |

**New words**
hand | leg | head | eye | ear | nose | mouth

**Note to the teacher**
* Use different combinations and variations for the activity.
* For instance, while reciting the poem, you may say ‘two little hands go...’ and remain silent while continuing to clap.
* Write sight words and new words on the board.

### Parts of the Body

Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
And eyes and ears
And mouth and nose
Head, shoulders, knees and toes

**Note to the teacher**
* As children sing, they touch the part of the body referred to.
* This song may be repeated till the child learns the part of the body.
* New ways of reciting could be thought of by the teacher.

### Let us speak

**A. Repeat after the teacher**

Teacher: I clap with my hands.
Children: I ...
